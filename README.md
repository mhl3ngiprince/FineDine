# Fine Dine - Restaurant Management System (RMS)

**Fine Dine is a comprehensive Android application designed to streamline restaurant operations for managers, staff, and customers.** It provides a user-friendly interface for managing menus, orders (implied), staff, and potentially reservations, all powered by a Firebase backend for real-time data synchronization and reliability.

## Features

    *   **Firebase Authentication (Likely):** For secure user login (staff and possibly customers).
*   **Modern Android Development Practices:**
    *   Utilizes Android Jetpack components (e.g., RecyclerView, ViewModel, LiveData - implied for a robust app).
    *   Clean architecture principles (implied by DAOs like `FirebaseStaffDao`).
    *   Material Design components for a consistent and intuitive UI.
*   **User Roles:** Differentiated user experience and access control based on roles (e.g., Manager, Waiter, Customer).
